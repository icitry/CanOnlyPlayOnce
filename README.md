If gaming has become too easy for you, fret not, I come forward with the most difficult challenge of all: a game you can only play ONCE.

Making use of a multitude of techniques and technologies, some more volatile than others (ahem, Jetpack Compose Multiplatform), various browser fingerprinting techniques, ranging from graphical, to audio and even network-level approaches, I aim to create a game that, once played, can never be replayed, no matter how hard one may try to do it.
